Hello there!

My name is Mark and I am learning C# and .NET, to become a developer.

I like making games in unity and getting better at writing code. 
It is among some of the greatest feelings to see your programs working propperly after all the hard work. 

I would love to collaborate in case you have any projects that you would need any help with!
